# Privacy-Preserving Quality Inspection System
## Video Narration (1-Minute)

Introducing the Privacy-Preserving Quality Inspection System - a comprehensive FHEVM example hub built for the Zama Bounty Program. This standalone Hardhat-based project demonstrates how to build confidential smart contracts using Fully Homomorphic Encryption, where data stays encrypted while computation happens securely on blockchain.

The core smart contract implements encrypted quality inspection with role-based access control. Notice the FHE data types euint8 and euint32 - these keep all sensitive data encrypted throughout execution. Functions include authorization management, secure inspection recording, cross-inspector verification, and privacy-preserving metrics calculation.

Running our comprehensive test suite with forty-plus test cases covering deployment, authorization, inspection recording, verification, metrics calculation, emergency functions, and edge cases. All tests pass successfully, demonstrating complete functionality and security.

Our TypeScript-based automation tools generate new FHEVM example projects instantly. The create-fhevm-example script creates standalone repositories with complete Hardhat setup, smart contracts, and tests. The documentation generator automatically produces API documentation from code annotations. The category generator organizes examples by learning difficulty.

The intuitive web interface allows inspectors to record quality data securely. MetaMask integration enables blockchain connection. Form input sends encrypted data to the smart contract where validation happens on encrypted values without ever decrypting.

Deploying to Sepolia testnet using our deployment script. The contract deploys successfully with full FHE capabilities. Contract is immediately verified on Etherscan for transparency and verifiability.

Comprehensive documentation includes quick start guide, complete tutorial with code examples, developer API reference, deployment guide, submission checklist, and troubleshooting. Fifty-plus code examples demonstrate common patterns and use cases.

This project meets all Zama Bounty Program requirements. We provide a standalone Hardhat template, automated scaffolding tools, documentation generation, category-based organization, multiple example types, clean automation tools, comprehensive testing, and professional documentation.
