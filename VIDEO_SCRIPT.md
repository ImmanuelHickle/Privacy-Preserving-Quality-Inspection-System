# Privacy-Preserving Quality Inspection System
## 1-Minute Video Demonstration Script

---

## SCENE 1: PROJECT INTRODUCTION
**Visual**: Show project title and project repository
**Background**: Modern tech animation with lock/privacy icons

Introducing the Privacy-Preserving Quality Inspection System - a comprehensive FHEVM example hub built for the Zama Bounty Program. This standalone Hardhat-based project demonstrates how to build confidential smart contracts using Fully Homomorphic Encryption, where data stays encrypted while computation happens securely on blockchain.

---

## SCENE 2: SMART CONTRACT OVERVIEW
**Visual**: Display PrivacyQualityInspection.sol contract code
**Highlighting**: Key functions and FHE operations

The core smart contract implements encrypted quality inspection with role-based access control. Notice the FHE data types euint8 and euint32 - these keep all sensitive data encrypted throughout execution. Functions include authorization management, secure inspection recording, cross-inspector verification, and privacy-preserving metrics calculation.

## SCENE 3: RUNNING TESTS
**Visual**: Execute npm test command in terminal
**Show**: Test output with passing checkmarks

Running our comprehensive test suite with forty-plus test cases covering deployment, authorization, inspection recording, verification, metrics calculation, emergency functions, and edge cases. All tests pass successfully, demonstrating complete functionality and security.

---

## SCENE 4: AUTOMATION TOOLS
**Visual**: Show script generation with CLI commands
**Display**: Creating example projects

Our TypeScript-based automation tools generate new FHEVM example projects instantly. The create-fhevm-example script creates standalone repositories with complete Hardhat setup, smart contracts, and tests. The documentation generator automatically produces API documentation from code annotations. The category generator organizes examples by learning difficulty.

## SCENE 5: FRONTEND INTERFACE
**Visual**: Web browser showing quality inspection form
**Interaction**: Entering quality data and submitting

The intuitive web interface allows inspectors to record quality data securely. MetaMask integration enables blockchain connection. Form input sends encrypted data to the smart contract where validation happens on encrypted values without ever decrypting.

## SCENE 6: DEPLOYMENT DEMONSTRATION
**Visual**: Terminal showing deployment process
**Display**: Contract deployment to Sepolia testnet

Deploying to Sepolia testnet using our deployment script. The contract deploys successfully with full FHE capabilities. Contract is immediately verified on Etherscan for transparency and verifiability.
